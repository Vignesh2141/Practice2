Java Version Control

**Java 1.1 :**

Java 1.1, also known as Java 1.1.x or Java 1.1 Standard Edition, was released on February 19, 1997. This version of Java introduced several important features and enhancements compared to its predecessor, Java 1.0. Here are some of the key features introduced in Java 1.1:

1) **Inner Classes**: Java 1.1 added support for inner classes, also known as nested classes. Inner classes allow you to define a class within another class, which can be useful for encapsulation and organization of code.
   ```java  
          public class OuterClass {
          private int outerVariable;

          public void outerMethod() {
          System.out.println("Outer method");
          }

          // Inner class
          public class InnerClass {
          private int innerVariable;

          public void innerMethod() {
            System.out.println("Inner method");
         }
         }
         }
    ```
2) **JavaBeans**: JavaBeans is a software component model for Java, and Java 1.1 included the initial support for it. JavaBeans are reusable software components that can be visually manipulated in builder tools.
     ```java
         import java.io.Serializable;

         public class Person implements Serializable {
         private String name;
         private int age;

         // Default constructor (required for JavaBeans)
         public Person() {
         }

         // Getter and setter methods (JavaBeans   property accessors)
         public String getName() {
            return name;
         }

         public void setName(String name) {
           this.name = name;
         }

         public int getAge() {
           return age;
         }

         public void setAge(int age) {
           this.age = age;
         }
         }
      ```
3) **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**: Java 1.1 improved the RMI capabilities introduced in Java 1.0. RMI allows Java objects to invoke methods on objects running in other Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), enabling distributed computing and communication between Java applications over a network.
   ```java
        import java.rmi.Remote;
        import java.rmi.RemoteException;

        public interface HelloService extends Remote {
        String sayHello(String name) throws RemoteException;
        }
    ```
    ```java
        import java.rmi.RemoteException;
        import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

        public class HelloServiceImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements HelloService {
        public HelloServiceImpl() throws RemoteException {
        super();
        }

        @Override
        public String sayHello(String name) throws RemoteException {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        }
        }
     ```  

     ```java
       import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
       import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

       public class Server {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            HelloService helloService = new HelloServiceImpl();
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            registry.rebind("HelloService", helloService);
            System.out.println("Server started.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```java
        import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
        import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

        public class Client {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("localhost", 1099);
            HelloService helloService = (HelloService) registry.lookup("HelloService");
            String result = helloService.sayHello("John");
            System.out.println("Server response: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }
    }
    ```
4) **JAR (Java Archive) Files:** Java 1.1 introduced the JAR file format, which is a compressed file format used for packaging Java class files, associated metadata, and resources into a single archive. JAR files make distribution and deployment of Java applications more efficient.
   ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
    }

   ```
    Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Java source files, and execute the following commands to compile the classes:
   ```
     javac HelloWorld.java
     javac Greet.java
   ```
   Create a text file named manifest.txt and add the following contents:
   ```
   Main-Class: HelloWorld
   ```
   Run the following command to create a JAR file named myapp.jar, including the compiled classes and the manifest file:

   ```
   jar cvfm myapp.jar manifest.txt HelloWorld.class Greet.class
   ```
   Run the following command to execute the JAR file:
   ```
   java -jar myapp.jar
   ```

5) **Java Foundation Classes (JFC)**: Java 1.1 included the Java Foundation Classes, which comprised the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, and Accessibility APIs. Swing provided a more modern and flexible GUI framework compared to the original AWT.
   ```java
        import javax.swing.*;

        public class SwingExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a JFrame (window)
            JFrame frame = new JFrame("Swing Example");
            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

            // Create a JLabel (text label)
            JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, Swing!");
            label.setHorizontalAlignment(SwingConstants.CENTER);

            // Add the label to the frame's content pane
            frame.getContentPane().add(label);

            // Set the size and make the frame visible
            frame.setSize(300, 200);
            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
            frame.setVisible(true);
        }
        }
    ```
6) **Java IDL (Interface Definition Language)**: Java 1.1 added support for Java IDL, allowing Java objects to participate in CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) distributed systems.
     Create a file named Hello.idl with the following content:

   ```
     module HelloApp {
     interface Hello {
        string sayHello();
     };
     };

   ```

     Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Hello.idl file. Use the idlj command to generate the Java stubs and skeletons for the IDL interface:
    
    ```
     idlj -fall Hello.idl
    ```

   Create a Java class that implements the generated skeleton interface. For example, create a file named HelloImpl.java with the following content:

   ```
        import HelloApp.HelloPOA;

        public class HelloImpl extends HelloPOA {
        @Override
        public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, world!";
        }
        }
   ```

   Create a server application that binds the implemented object to a naming service. For example, create a file named Server.java with the following content:

   ```java
        import org.omg.CORBA.ORB;
        import org.omg.CosNaming.*;
        import org.omg.PortableServer.*;

        public class Server {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);

            HelloImpl helloImpl = new HelloImpl();

            // Get the root naming context
            org.omg.CORBA.Object objRef = orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
            NamingContextExt ncRef = NamingContextExtHelper.narrow(objRef);

            // Bind the object to the naming service
            String name = "Hello";
            NameComponent[] path = ncRef.to_name(name);
            ncRef.rebind(path, helloImpl._this(orb));

            System.out.println("Server started.");
            orb.run();
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            }
            }
           }
     ```

7) **Collections Framework**: Java 1.1 introduced the Collections framework, which provided a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps. It included the java.util package with classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.
   ```java
         import java.util.ArrayList;
         import java.util.HashSet;
         import java.util.List;
         import java.util.Set;

         public class CollectionsExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
         // Example of using ArrayList (a type of List)
         List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

         // Adding elements to the list
         myList.add("Apple");
         myList.add("Banana");
         myList.add("Orange");
         myList.add("Grapes");

         // Accessing elements in the list
         System.out.println("Elements in the list:");
         for (String fruit : myList) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
         }

         // Example of using HashSet (a type of Set)
         Set<Integer> mySet = new HashSet<>();

         // Adding elements to the set
         mySet.add(10);
         mySet.add(20);
         mySet.add(30);
         mySet.add(40);
         mySet.add(50);
         mySet.add(20); // Adding a duplicate element (will be ignored)

         // Accessing elements in the set
         System.out.println("\nElements in the set:");
         for (int number : mySet) {
            System.out.println(number);
         }
         }
         }
    ```
    
   
8) **Java 2D API**: Java 1.1 included enhancements to the 2D graphics capabilities, introducing the Java 2D API. This API offered more advanced graphics rendering and image manipulation capabilities.
   ```java
          import javax.swing.*;
          import java.awt.*;

          public class Java2DExample extends JFrame {
          public Java2DExample() {
          setTitle("Java 2D Example");
          setSize(400, 400);
          setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
         }

          @Override
          public void paint(Graphics g) {
          super.paint(g);
          Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;

          // Draw a rectangle
          g2d.setColor(Color.BLUE);
          g2d.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);

          // Draw an ellipse
          g2d.setColor(Color.RED);
          g2d.fillOval(200, 100, 100, 150);

          // Draw a line
          g2d.setColor(Color.GREEN);
          g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(5));
          g2d.drawLine(50, 250, 300, 250);

         // Draw an image
         ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("path_to_your_image.jpg");
         Image image = icon.getImage();
         g2d.drawImage(image, 150, 200, this);
         }

         public static void main(String[] args) {
         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            Java2DExample example = new Java2DExample();
            example.setVisible(true);
         });
        }
        } 
    ```


9)  **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: While JDBC was introduced in Java 1.0, Java
1\.1 provided improved support for this API, which allows Java applications to interact with relational databases.
     ```java
              import java.sql.*;

              public class JDBCExample {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
              String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
              String user = "your_username";
              String password = "your_password";

              try {
                // Establish the connection to the database
                   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

                // Perform database operations
                // For example, querying data from the "employees" table
                String query = "SELECT * FROM employees";
                Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
                ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);

                // Process the query results
                while (resultSet.next()) {
                 int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
                 String name = resultSet.getString("name");
                 System.out.println("Employee ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
                }

                // Close resources
                resultSet.close();
                statement.close();
                connection.close();
               } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
               }
              }
             }
    ```

10) **Reflection API Enhancements**: Java 1.1 improved the Reflection API, allowing
developers to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, and fields at runtime.

    ```java
            import java.lang.reflect.Field;
            import java.lang.reflect.Method;

            public class ReflectionExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
            // Get the Class object for the desired class (in this example, we use the String class)
            Class<?> stringClass = String.class;

            // Inspect and print the methods of the class
            System.out.println("Methods of the String class:");
            Method[] methods = stringClass.getDeclaredMethods();
            for (Method method : methods) {
                System.out.println(method.getName());
            }

            // Inspect and print the fields of the class
            System.out.println("\nFields of the String class:");
            Field[] fields = stringClass.getDeclaredFields();
            for (Field field : fields) {
                System.out.println(field.getName());
            }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            }
            }
    ```

11) **New Security Model**: Java 1.1 introduced an updated security model with the ability to
restrict applets' access to system resources, providing better control over untrusted code.

   ```java
             import java.applet.Applet;
             import java.awt.*;

             public class FileReadApplet extends Applet {
              public void init() {
              try {
             // Attempt to read a file (This is an  unsafe operation in an applet)
              FileReader reader = new FileReader("my_file.txt");
              int ch;
               while ((ch = reader.read()) != -1) {
                 System.out.print((char) ch);
               } 
              reader.close();
             } catch (Exception e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
             }
             }
             } 
```

**Java 1.2 :**

Java 1.2, released in December 1998, brought significant improvements and new features to the language. Some of the key concepts introduced in Java 1.2 include:

1) **Collections Framework** : Java 1.2 introduced the Collections Framework, which provided a set of standard interfaces and classes for handling collections of objects. This framework included interfaces like List, Set, and Map, along with implementations such as ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap. The Collections Framework made it easier to manage and manipulate groups of objects.
   ```java
         import java.util.ArrayList;
         import java.util.List;

         public class CollectionsExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
         // Create a list of strings using the ArrayList implementation
         List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

         // Add elements to the list
         myList.add("Apple");
         myList.add("Banana");
         myList.add("Orange");
         myList.add("Grapes");

         // Access elements in the list
         System.out.println("Elements in the list:");
         for (String fruit : myList) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
         }

         // Get the size of the list
         int size = myList.size();
         System.out.println("Size of the list: " + size);

         // Check if the list contains a specific element
         boolean containsBanana = myList.contains("Banana");
         System.out.println("List contains 'Banana': " + containsBanana);

         // Remove an element from the list
         myList.remove("Orange");
         System.out.println("List after removing 'Orange': " + myList);
         }
        }
    ```

2) **Swing GUILibrary** : Java 1.2 introduced Swing, a powerful and flexible GUI(Graphical User Interface) library. Swing replaced the previous AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and offered a more lightweight and platform-independent solution for creating graphical user interfaces. Swing components are rendered entirely in Java, which improved performance and consistency across different platforms.
   ```java
            import javax.swing.*;
            import java.awt.*;
            import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
            import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

            public class SwingExample {
               public static void main(String[] args) {
               // Create the main frame
               JFrame frame = new JFrame("Swing Example");
               frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
               frame.setLayout(new FlowLayout());

               // Create a label
               JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, Swing!");
               frame.add(label);

               // Create a button
               JButton button = new JButton("Click Me!");
               frame.add(button);

              // Add an action listener to the button
              button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
              public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                 label.setText("Button Clicked!");
               }
              });

             // Set the frame size and make it visible
              frame.setSize(300, 150);
              frame.setVisible(true);
             }
            }
    ```

3) **Java 2DAPI**: Java 1.2 included the Java 2D API,which provided extensive support for 2D graphics and imaging operations. This APIallowed developers to draw and manipulate shapes, images, and text in a more sophisticated manner.
   ```java
        import javax.swing.*;
        import java.awt.*;
        import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;
        import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

        public class Java2DAPIExample extends JFrame {
            private BufferedImage image;

            public Java2DAPIExample() {
                setTitle("Java 2D API Example");
                setSize(400, 400);
                setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

            // Create a buffered image
            image = new BufferedImage(400, 400, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);

            // Draw on the buffered image
            drawShapesAndImage();

            // Display the image using a custom JPanel
            add(new ImagePanel(image));
            }

            private void drawShapesAndImage() {
                Graphics2D g2d = image.createGraphics();

                // Set background color
                g2d.setColor(Color.WHITE);
                g2d.fillRect(0, 0, image.getWidth(), image.getHeight());

                // Draw a filled rectangle
                g2d.setColor(Color.BLUE);
                g2d.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);

                // Draw a filled ellipse
                g2d.setColor(Color.RED);
                g2d.fill(new Ellipse2D.Double(200, 100, 100, 150));

                // Load an image and draw it on the buffered image
                ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("path_to_your_image.jpg");
                Image img = icon.getImage();
                g2d.drawImage(img, 150, 200, this);

                g2d.dispose();
        }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            Java2DAPIExample example = new Java2DAPIExample();
            example.setVisible(true);
        });
    }

    // Custom JPanel to display the image
        private static class ImagePanel extends JPanel {
            private BufferedImage image;

            public ImagePanel(BufferedImage image) {
            this.image = image;
            setPreferredSize(new Dimension(image.getWidth(), image.getHeight()));
            }

            @Override
            protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
            super.paintComponent(g);
            g.drawImage(image, 0, 0, this);
            }
        }
    }
   ```

4) **JavaBeans** : Java 1.2 formalized the JavaBeans component architecture. JavaBeans are reusable software components that can be manipulated visually in builder tools. They follow a set of conventions for properties, events, and methods, making it easier to create and integrate components in GUI-based applications.
   ```java 
        import java.io.Serializable;

        public class PersonBean implements Serializable {
            private String name;
            private int age;
            private String email;

            // Default constructor (required for JavaBeans)
            public PersonBean() {
            }

            // Getter and Setter methods for properties (JavaBeans convention)
            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }

            public void setName(String name) {
                this.name = name;
             }

            public int getAge() {
                return age;
            }

            public void setAge(int age) {
                this.age = age;
            }

            public String getEmail() {
                return email;
            }

            public void setEmail(String email) {
                this.email = email;
            }

            // Other methods (not mandatory for JavaBeans, but can be included)
            public void printInfo() {
                System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Email: " + email);
            }
        }
   ```

5) **Just-In-Time (JIT) CompilerEnhancements** : Java 1.2 introduced improvements to the JIT compiler,which helped boost the overall performance of Java programs. The JIT compiler translates Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving execution speed.
   ```java
        public class JITCompilerExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int iterations = 1000000000;
                long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

                for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
                    // Perform some computation (e.g., adding two numbers)
                        int result = i + 10;
                }

                long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
                System.out.println("Time taken: " + (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
            }
        }
   ```

6) **Reflection Enhancements** : Java 1.2 introduced additional capabilities for reflection, allowing developers to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and constructors dynamically. Reflection is useful for building advanced frameworks, debugging tools, and other sophisticated applications.
   ```java
            public class Calculator {
                private int result;

                public Calculator() {
                result = 0;
            }

            public int add(int num1, int num2) {
                result = num1 + num2;
                return result;
            }

            public int subtract(int num1, int num2) {
                result = num1 - num2;
                return result;
            }
        }
    ```
    Now, lets use reflection to inspect and invoke the "add" and "subtract" methods dynamically:
    ```java
            import java.lang.reflect.Method;

            public class ReflectionExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                    // Get the Class object for the Calculator class
                    Class<?> calculatorClass = Calculator.class;

                    // Create an instance of the Calculator class
                    Object calculatorInstance = calculatorClass.newInstance();

                    // Get the Method object for the "add" method
                    Method addMethod = calculatorClass.getDeclaredMethod("add", int.class, int.class);

                    // Invoke the "add" method dynamically
                    int resultAdd = (int) addMethod.invoke(calculatorInstance, 10, 20);
                    System.out.println("Result of add method: " + resultAdd);

                    // Get the Method object for the "subtract" method
                    Method subtractMethod = calculatorClass.getDeclaredMethod("subtract", int.class, int.class);

                    // Invoke the "subtract" method dynamically
                    int resultSubtract = (int) subtractMethod.invoke(calculatorInstance, 30, 5);
                    System.out.println("Result of subtract method: " + resultSubtract);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
   ```

7) **Accessibility API**: Java 1.2 introduced the Accessibility API,which enabled developers to create applications that are more accessible to users with disabilities. The APIallowed assistive technologies to interact with Java applications, improving their usability for users with special needs.These features significantly enhanced Java's capabilities and made it more suitable for developing complex and robust applications, especially in the areas of graphical user interfaces, data manipulation, and component-based development. However,it's important to note that Java has evolved significantly since Java 1.2, with many more features and improvements added in subsequent versions.
   ```java
        import javax.swing.*;
        import java.awt.*;
        import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
        import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

        public class AccessibleCalculator extends JFrame {
            private JTextField display;

            public AccessibleCalculator() {
                setTitle("Accessible Calculator");
                setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                setLayout(new BorderLayout());

                display = new JTextField();
                display.setEditable(false);
                display.setFont(new Font("Arial", Font.PLAIN, 20));
                display.setHorizontalAlignment(JTextField.RIGHT);
                add(display, BorderLayout.NORTH);

                JPanel buttonPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(4, 4, 5, 5));
                String[] buttonLabels = {"7", "8", "9", "/",
                                 "4", "5", "6", "*",
                                 "1", "2", "3", "-",
                                 "0", ".", "=", "+"};

                for (String label : buttonLabels) {
                    JButton button = new JButton(label);
                    button.setFont(new Font("Arial", Font.PLAIN, 16));
                    button.addActionListener(new ButtonListener());
                    buttonPanel.add(button);
                }

                add(buttonPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);

                pack();
                setLocationRelativeTo(null);
            }

            private class ButtonListener implements ActionListener {
                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                    String command = e.getActionCommand();
                if (command.equals("=")) {
                    calculateResult();
                } else {
                    display.setText(display.getText() + command);
                }
            }

            private void calculateResult() {
                // Implement the calculation logic here
                // For simplicity, this example doesn't include the actual calculation
                // The result will be displayed in the text field
            }
        }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
                AccessibleCalculator calculator = new AccessibleCalculator();
                calculator.setVisible(true);
            });
        }
    }
   ```

**Java 1.3**

Java 1.3, also known as Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.3, was released on May 8, 2000. It introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessor, Java 1.2. Here are some notable features of Java 1.3:

1) **HotSpot JVM:** Java 1.3 included the HotSpot JVM (Java Virtual Machine) as the default virtual machine. HotSpot was designed to improve Java's performance by dynamically optimizing the execution of Java bytecode.
  ```java
        public class SumCalculator {
            public static int calculateSum(int n) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                    sum += i;
                }
                return sum;
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int n = 1000000000;
                long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

                int result = calculateSum(n);

                long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
                System.out.println("Sum of the first " + n + " natural numbers: " + result);
                System.out.println("Time taken: " + (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
            }
        }
  ```

2) **Java Sound API**: Java 1.3 introduced the Java Sound API,which provided a platform-independent way to work with audio, including playback, recording, and MIDI(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) functionality.Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI): JNDI was introduced in Java 1.3, providing a unified interface to access various naming and directory services, such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), DNS(Domain Name System),
   ```java
            import javax.sound.sampled.*;

            public class AudioPlaybackExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Set the path to the audio file
                        String audioFilePath = "path_to_your_audio_file.wav";

                        // Get an audio input stream from the file
                        AudioInputStream audioInputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(AudioPlaybackExample.class.getResource(audioFilePath));

                        // Get the audio format of the file
                        AudioFormat format = audioInputStream.getFormat();

                        // Open a data line to play the audio
                        DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(SourceDataLine.class, format);
                        SourceDataLine dataLine = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
                        dataLine.open(format);

                        // Start playback
                        dataLine.start();

                        // Create a buffer for reading audio data from the stream
                        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
                        int bytesRead = 0;

                        // Read audio data from the stream and write it to the data line for playback
                        while ((bytesRead = audioInputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                            dataLine.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                        }

                        // Close the data line and the audio stream
                        dataLine.drain();
                        dataLine.close();
                        audioInputStream.close();
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```

3) **Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)**: Java 1.3 included the JSSE API,which provided support for secure communication over networks using protocols such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS(Transport Layer Security).Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) 2.0: Java 1.3 introduced an updated version of JDBC, which added several enhancements, including support for new data types, scrollable result sets, and batch updates.
   Server code
   ```java
        import javax.net.ssl.*;
        import java.io.*;
        import java.security.*;

        public class SecureServer {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    SSLServerSocketFactory ssf = (SSLServerSocketFactory) SSLServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
                    SSLServerSocket serverSocket = (SSLServerSocket) ssf.createServerSocket(8888);

                    System.out.println("Server is waiting for connections...");

                    SSLSocket clientSocket = (SSLSocket) serverSocket.accept();
                    System.out.println("Client connected!");

                    // Perform server-side operations with the client

                    clientSocket.close();
                    serverSocket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
   ```
   Client Code:
   ```java
        import javax.net.ssl.*;
        import java.io.*;
        import java.security.*;

        public class SecureClient {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    SSLSocketFactory sf = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
                    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sf.createSocket("localhost", 8888);

                    System.out.println("Connected to the server!");

                    // Perform client-side operations with the server

                    socket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
   ```
   Java Code:
    ```java
        import java.sql.*;

        public class JdbcExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
                String user = "your_username";
                String password = "your_password";

                try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
                    Statement statement = conn.createStatement();

                    // Enable batch updates
                    conn.setAutoCommit(false);

                    // Add batched SQL statements
                    statement.addBatch("INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30)");
                    statement.addBatch("INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'Bob', 25)");
                    statement.addBatch("INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'Carol', 28)");

                    // Execute the batch
                    int[] updateCounts = statement.executeBatch();

                    // Commit the batch updates
                    conn.commit();

                    System.out.println("Batch updates executed successfully!");
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
   ```

4) **RMIActivation**: Remote Method Invocation (RMI)activation was introduced in Java 1.3, allowing objects to be automatically activated and deactivated in a distributed computing environment.  
   
   Create the Remote Interface (MyRemoteInterface.java):
   ```java
        import java.rmi.Remote;
        import java.rmi.RemoteException;

        public interface MyRemoteInterface extends Remote {
            String sayHello() throws RemoteException;
        }
   ```
   Create the Remote Object Implementation (MyRemoteObject.java):

   ```java
            import java.rmi.RemoteException;
            import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

            public class MyRemoteObject extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
                protected MyRemoteObject() throws RemoteException {
                    super();
                }

                @Override
                public String sayHello() throws RemoteException {
                    return "Hello, this is a remotely activated object!";
                }
            }
   ```
   Create the Server (MyRemoteServer.java):

   ```java
        import java.rmi.Naming;
        import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;

        public class MyRemoteServer {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    MyRemoteObject remoteObject = new MyRemoteObject();

                    // Create and start the RMI Registry
                    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);

                    // Bind the remote object to the RMI Registry
                    Naming.rebind("MyRemoteObject", remoteObject);

                    System.out.println("Remote object bound and ready for activation!");
                } catch (Exception e) {
                     e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
   ```
   Create the Client (MyRemoteClient.java):
   ```java
            import java.rmi.Naming;

            public class MyRemoteClient {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Lookup the remote object from the RMI Registry
                        MyRemoteInterface remoteObject = (MyRemoteInterface) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost/MyRemoteObject");

                        // Call the remote method
                        String result = remoteObject.sayHello();
                        System.out.println(result);
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```
   Compile all the Java files:
     ```
       javac MyRemoteInterface.java MyRemoteObject.java MyRemoteServer.java MyRemoteClient.java

     ```
   Start the RMI Registry in a separate terminal or command prompt:
     ```
       rmiregistry
     ```
   Run the server (MyRemoteServer):
     ``` 
     Run the server (MyRemoteServer): 
     ```
   Run the client (MyRemoteClient):
     ```
      java MyRemoteClient
     ```

5) **XMLParsing**: Java 1.3 included improved XMLparsing capabilities with the addition of the javax.xml.parsers package, which provided standardized APIs for parsing XMLdocuments.
   Suppose we have an XML document named "example.xml" that looks like this:
   ```xml
        <bookstore>
            <book category="Science Fiction">
                <title>Dune</title>
                <author>Frank Herbert</author>
                <year>1965</year>
            </book>
            <book category="Fantasy">
                <title>The Hobbit</title>
                <author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
                <year>1937</year>
            </book>
        </bookstore>
   ```
   Create the XMLParserExample.java:
   ```java
        import org.w3c.dom.*;
        import javax.xml.parsers.*;
        import java.io.*;

        public class XMLParserExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    // Load and parse the XML document
                    DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
                    DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
                    Document doc = builder.parse(new File("example.xml"));

                    // Get the root element
                    Element root = doc.getDocumentElement();

                    // Get a list of all book elements
                    NodeList bookList = root.getElementsByTagName("book");

                    // Iterate through the book elements and extract information
                    for (int i = 0; i < bookList.getLength(); i++) {
                        Element bookElement = (Element) bookList.item(i);
                        String category = bookElement.getAttribute("category");
                        String title = getElementValue(bookElement, "title");
                        String author = getElementValue(bookElement, "author");
                        String year = getElementValue(bookElement, "year");

                        System.out.println("Category: " + category);
                        System.out.println("Title: " + title);
                        System.out.println("Author: " + author);
                        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
                        System.out.println();
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }

            // Helper method to get the text value of a child element
            private static String getElementValue(Element parentElement, String tagName) {
                NodeList nodeList = parentElement.getElementsByTagName(tagName);
                Element element = (Element) nodeList.item(0);
                return element.getTextContent();
            }
        }
   ```
6) **Swing Enhancements**: Java 1.3 included various enhancements to the Swing GUI(Graphical User Interface) framework, improving performance and adding new components and features
   ```java
            import javax.swing.*;
            import java.awt.*;

            public class GroupLayoutExample extends JFrame {
                public GroupLayoutExample() {
                    setTitle("GroupLayout Example");
                    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

                    // Create buttons
                    JButton button1 = new JButton("Button 1");
                    JButton button2 = new JButton("Button 2");
                    JButton button3 = new JButton("Button 3");

                    // Set the GroupLayout
                    GroupLayout layout = new GroupLayout(getContentPane());
                    getContentPane().setLayout(layout);

                    // Automatically create gaps between components
                    layout.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
                    layout.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);

                    // Define the horizontal layout
                    layout.setHorizontalGroup(layout.createSequentialGroup()
                            .addComponent(button1)
                            .addComponent(button2)
                            .addComponent(button3));

                    // Define the vertical layout
                    layout.setVerticalGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(GroupLayout.Alignment.BASELINE)
                            .addComponent(button1)
                            .addComponent(button2)
                            .addComponent(button3));

                    pack();
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
                        GroupLayoutExample example = new GroupLayoutExample();
                        example.setVisible(true);
                    });
                }
            }

   ```

7) **Collection Framework Enhancements**: Java 1.3 introduced several additions and improvements to the Collection Framework, including the PriorityQueue class, the ability to sort arrays using the Arrays class, and enhancements to the java.util.Collections class.
   Example of using PriorityQueue:
   ```java
        import java.util.PriorityQueue;

        public class PriorityQueueExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();

                // Adding elements to the priority queue
                priorityQueue.add(10);
                priorityQueue.add(5);
                priorityQueue.add(20);
                priorityQueue.add(15);

                // Dequeue elements based on priority (ascending order in this case)
                while (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {
                    System.out.println(priorityQueue.poll());
                }
            }
        }
   ```
   Example of sorting an array of integers:
   ```java
            import java.util.Arrays;

            public class ArraysSortExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int[] numbers = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3};

                    // Sort the array in ascending order
                    Arrays.sort(numbers);

                    // Print the sorted array
                    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
                }
            }

   ```
   Example of using Collections.reverse():

   ```java 
            import java.util.*;

            public class CollectionsExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

                    // Reverse the list
                    Collections.reverse(numbers);

                    // Print the reversed list
                    System.out.println(numbers);
                }
            }

   ```



Java 1.4

Java 1.4, also known as Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.4, was released on February 6, 2002. It introduced several new features and improvements to the Java programming language. Some of the key features included in Java 1.4 are as follows:

1) **New I/O API (NIO):** Java 1.4 introduced the java.nio package, which provided a more scalable and efficient I/O (Input/Output) framework compared to the It introduced concepts such as channels, buffers, and selectors, which allowed for non-blocking I/O operations. traditional java.io package.  
 
    ```java 
                import java.io.IOException;
                import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
                import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
                import java.nio.file.*;

                public class NIOExample {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        try {
                            // Path to the file
                            Path filePath = Paths.get("example.txt");

                            // Open a FileChannel using NIO
                            try (FileChannel fileChannel = FileChannel.open(filePath, StandardOpenOption.READ)) {
                                // Create a ByteBuffer to hold the data
                                ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

                                int bytesRead;
                                while ((bytesRead = fileChannel.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                                    buffer.flip(); // Prepare the buffer for reading
                                    while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                                        System.out.print((char) buffer.get()); // Print character by character
                                    }
                                    buffer.clear(); // Prepare the buffer for writing again
                                }
                            }
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                }
   
     ```



1) **Assertions (assert keyword)**: Java 1.4 added support for assertions using the assert keyword. Assertions are used for testing assumptions about the code during development and can be enabled or disabled at runtime. They help catch programming errors early in the development process.
   ```java
            public class AssertionExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int num = 10;

                // Assume that num should always be positive
                assert num > 0 : "num should be positive";

                System.out.println("Value of num: " + num);

                // Some more code...
            }
        }
   ```
   
2) **Regular Expressions (java.util.regex)**: The java.util.regex package was added, providing support for regular expressions in Java. This allowed developers to perform advanced string pattern matching and manipulation tasks.
   ```java
        import java.util.regex.*;

        public class RegexExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String text = "Hello, my email is john@example.com, and my phone number is (123) 456-7890.";

                // Regular expression to match email addresses
                String emailRegex = "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}";

                // Regular expression to match phone numbers in the format (123) 456-7890
                String phoneRegex = "\\(\\d{3}\\) \\d{3}-\\d{4}";

                // Pattern objects for email and phone number regex
                Pattern emailPattern = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
                Pattern phonePattern = Pattern.compile(phoneRegex);

                // Matcher objects to find matches in the text
                Matcher emailMatcher = emailPattern.matcher(text);
                Matcher phoneMatcher = phonePattern.matcher(text);

                // Find and print all email addresses in the text
                System.out.println("Email addresses found:");
                while (emailMatcher.find()) {
                    System.out.println(emailMatcher.group());
                }

                // Find and print all phone numbers in the text
                System.out.println("\nPhone numbers found:");
                while (phoneMatcher.find()) {
                    System.out.println(phoneMatcher.group());
                }
            }
        }
   ```

3) **Improved Exception Handling:** Java 1.4 introduced chained exceptions, which allowed exceptions to be linked together, providing more detailed information about the root
   ```java 
            public class ChainedExceptionExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    divideByZero();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    // Print the chain of exceptions
                    printChainedExceptions(e);
                }
            }

            public static void divideByZero() {
                try {
                    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
                } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                    // Wrap the caught exception with a new exception and add more context
                    throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred while dividing.", e);
                }
            }

            public static void printChainedExceptions(Throwable e) {
                System.out.println("Exception chain:");
                while (e != null) {
                    System.out.println(e.getClass().getName() + ": " + e.getMessage());
                    e = e.getCause();
                }
            }
        }

   ```

4) **Java Web Start:** Java Web Start (javaws) was introduced in Java 1.4 as a way to deploy and run Java applications over the internet. It provided a framework for launching applications  

    Create a Java Web Start Application:

    ```java 
            // HelloWorld.java
            import javax.swing.*;

            public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
                        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Java Web Start Example");
                        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                        JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello, World!");
                        frame.getContentPane().add(label);
                        frame.pack();
                        frame.setVisible(true);
                    });
                }
            }

    ```

    Create a JNLP File (Java Network Launching Protocol):
    ```xml
            <!-- HelloWorld.jnlp -->
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
            <jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="https://example.com/webstart/" href="HelloWorld.jnlp">
                <information>
                    <title>HelloWorld Java Web Start</title>
                    <vendor>Example Corp</vendor>
                </information>
                <resources>
                    <j2se version="1.8+" />
                    <jar href="HelloWorld.jar" />
                </resources>
                <application-desc main-class="HelloWorld" />
            </jnlp>
    ```


5) **Java Plug-in 2 (deprecated)**: Java 1.4 introduced Java Plug-in 2, which provided an improved architecture for running Java applets in web browsers. However, this was later deprecated in favor of Java Plug-in 1.5 and then eventually removed from later Java versions.
   Create a Simple Java Applet:
   ```java
            // SimpleApplet.java
            import java.applet.Applet;
            import java.awt.*;

            public class SimpleApplet extends Applet {
                @Override
                public void init() {
                    setBackground(Color.WHITE);
                }

                @Override
                public void paint(Graphics g) {
                    g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
                    g.drawString("Hello, Java Applet!", 50, 50);
                }
            }

   ```
   Create the HTML File to Embed the Applet:

   ```html
            <!-- index.html -->
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Java Applet Example</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Welcome to Java Applet Example</h1>
                <applet code="SimpleApplet.class" width="300" height="100">
                    Your browser does not support Java applets.
                </applet>
            </body>
            </html>
  
   ```
   Compile the Java Applet:
    ```
       javac SimpleApplet.java
    ```

6) **Preferences API**: Java 1.4 added the java.util.prefs package, which allowed applications to store and retrieve user and system preferences persistently.
    ```java
            import java.util.prefs.Preferences;

            public class PreferencesExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Get the user preferences node for the current class
                    Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(PreferencesExample.class);

                    // Store some preferences
                    prefs.put("username", "john_doe");
                    prefs.putInt("age", 30);
                    prefs.putBoolean("isSubscribed", true);

                    // Retrieve preferences
                    String username = prefs.get("username", "default_username");
                    int age = prefs.getInt("age", 0);
                    boolean isSubscribed = prefs.getBoolean("isSubscribed", false);

                    // Print the retrieved preferences
                    System.out.println("Username: " + username);
                    System.out.println("Age: " + age);
                    System.out.println("Is Subscribed: " + isSubscribed);
                }
            }
   ```

7) **IPv6 Support:** Java 1.4 added support for IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) for networking operations.
   ```java
            import java.net.InetAddress;
            import java.net.UnknownHostException;

            public class IPv6Example {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Get the localhost InetAddress (IPv6 or IPv4 depending on system configuration)
                        InetAddress localhost = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
                        System.out.println("Localhost address: " + localhost);

                        // Get the InetAddress for an IPv6 address (loopback address "::1")
                        InetAddress ipv6Address = InetAddress.getByName("::1");
                        System.out.println("IPv6 loopback address: " + ipv6Address);

                        // Get the InetAddress for an IPv4 address (loopback address "127.0.0.1")
                        InetAddress ipv4Address = InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1");
                        System.out.println("IPv4 loopback address: " + ipv4Address);
                    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```
8) **New Collection Classes**: Java 1.4 introduced several new collection classes, including
TreeSet, TreeMap, and LinkedList.
    ```java 
                import java.util.*;

                public class CollectionExamples {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList(5, 2, 8, 1, 4));
                        System.out.println("TreeSet elements: " + treeSet);

                        TreeMap<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
                        treeMap.put("Alice", 30);
                        treeMap.put("Bob", 25);
                        treeMap.put("Charlie", 28);
                        treeMap.put("David", 33);
                        System.out.println("TreeMap elements (sorted by keys): " + treeMap);

                        LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Grapes", "Mango"));
                        System.out.println("LinkedList elements: " + linkedList);
                    }
                }
    ```

1)  **Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Enhancements**: Java 1.4 included improvements in the Java Cryptography Architecture, providing enhanced security features.
    ```java 
    
            import java.security.*;

            public class JCAExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Generate Key Pair
                        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
                        keyPairGenerator.initialize(1024); // Key size in bits
                        KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();

                        // Create Cipher Instance and Perform Encryption/Decryption
                        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
                        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPublic());
                        byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal("Hello, Java Cryptography!".getBytes());

                        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());
                        byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(encryptedBytes);

                        System.out.println("Encrypted Data: " + new String(encryptedBytes));
                        System.out.println("Decrypted Data: " + new String(decryptedBytes));
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
    ```

**Java 1.5 :**

Java 1.5, released in September 2004, was a major update to the Java programming language and platform. It introduced several important features and concepts that significantly improved developer productivity and code readability. Some of the key features and concepts introduced in Java 1.5 (also known as Java 5 or Java 5.0) include:

1. **Generics**: Generics introduced parameterized types, allowing classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on different data types while providing compile-time type safety. With generics, developers could create classes and methods that work with a specific type without casting and avoiding potential type-related errors.
**Example of using generics:**

    ```java

    List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>(); stringList.add("Hello");

    stringList.add("World");

    ```

2. **Enhanced for Loop :** The enhanced for loop (also known as the "for-each" loop) simplified iteration over collections and arrays. It provided a more concise syntax for looping through elements without the need for explicit indexing.
**Example of using the enhanced for loop:**

    ```java

    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"); for (String name : names) {

    System.out.println(name);

    }

    ```

3. **Autoboxing and Unboxing:** Java 1.5 introduced autoboxing, which automatically converted primitive data types (e.g., int, double) to their corresponding wrapper classes (e.g.,Integer, Double) when needed. Unboxing performed the reverse operation, converting wrapper classes back to primitives.
**Example of autoboxing and unboxing:**
    ```java

    int num = 42;

    Integer wrappedNum = num; // Autoboxing

    int unwrappedNum = wrappedNum; // Unboxing 
    ```

4. **Varargs (Variable-Length Arguments):** The varargs feature allowed methods to accept a variable number of arguments of the same type. It simplified the method invocation by allowing the caller to pass any number of arguments directly, without explicitly creating an array.
**Example of using varargs:** 

    ```java

                        public void printNumbers(int... numbers) { for (int num : numbers) { System.out.println(num);

                        }

                        }

                        printNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4); 
    ```

5. **Enums:** Java 1.5 introduced the enum type, providing a dedicated and type-safe way to represent a fixed set of constants. Enums replaced the traditional approach of using integer constants to represent choices or options.  
**Example of using enums:**

    ```java

            enum Day {

            MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }

            Day today = Day.MONDAY; 
    ```

6. **Annotations:** Java 1.5 introduced annotations, which allowed developers to add metadata and declarative information to classes, methods, and fields. Annotations became instrumental in providing information to tools, frameworks, and libraries during compilation or runtime.
**Example of a custom annotation:** 
    ```java

            @interface MyAnnotation {

            String value();

            }

            @MyAnnotation("Example") public class MyClass {

            // Class implementation

    }

    ```

These features and concepts significantly improved the Java programming experience by providing better type safety, more concise syntax, and enhanced support for meta-information. Java 1.5 played a crucial role in shaping modern Java development practices and laid the foundation for many subsequent language enhancements.

**Java 1.6**

Java 1.6, also known as Java SE 6 (Standard Edition 6), was released on December 11, 2006. It introduced several new features and improvements compared to its predecessor, Java 1.5. Here are some of the key features of Java 1.6:


1. **Compiler and Performance Enhancements**: Java 1.6 included improvements to the Java HotSpot virtual machine, the Java class libraries, and the Java compiler. These enhancements aimed to improve performance, reduce memory footprint, and increase scalability.
   ```java 
            public class PerformanceDemo {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Use StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation
                StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10000; i++) {
                    stringBuilder.append(i).append(", ");
                }
                String result = stringBuilder.toString();
                System.out.println(result);

                // Use enhanced for loop (foreach) for iterating over collections
                int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
                for (int number : numbers) {
                    System.out.print(number + " ");
                }
                System.out.println();

                // Use try-with-resources for automatic resource management (Java 7 and later)
                // In Java 1.6, use regular try-catch for resource management.
                try {
                    // Open a resource that needs to be automatically closed (e.g., a file)
                    // In Java 1.6, you'd explicitly close the resource in a finally block.
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

                // Use the improved Garbage Collector (G1 Collector) for large heap applications
                // Java 1.6 introduced the G1 Collector as an experimental feature.
                // In more recent Java versions, G1 Collector is the default garbage collector.

                // Other performance enhancements may include using specific data structures and algorithms
                // tailored to your application's requirements and employing multithreading for concurrent tasks.
            }
        }
    
   ```

2. **Scripting Support**: Java 1.6 introduced the Java Scripting API (javax.script), which provided a standard way to execute scripts written in different scripting languages, such as JavaScript, Groovy, Python, and Ruby, within a Java application.  



    ```java 
        import javax.script.*;

        public class ScriptingExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try {
                    // Create a ScriptEngineManager
                    ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();

                    // Get the JavaScript scripting engine
                    ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("javascript");

                    // Execute a simple JavaScript expression
                    String script = "var x = 5; var y = 10; x + y;";
                    Object result = engine.eval(script);

                    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
                } catch (ScriptException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }

   ```

3. **JDBC 4.0 Enhancements**: The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API received several enhancements in Java 1.6. The most notable improvement was the addition of the JDBC 4.0 API, which simplified database access by introducing features such as automatic driver loading and enhanced exception handling.
    ```java 
            import java.sql.*;

            public class JdbcExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
                    String user = "username";
                    String password = "password";

                    Connection connection = null;
                    Statement statement = null;
                    ResultSet resultSet = null;

                    try {
                        Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
                        connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
                        statement = connection.createStatement();
                        resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM employees");

                        while (resultSet.next()) {
                            int id = resultSet.getInt("employee_id");
                            String name = resultSet.getString("employee_name");
                            double salary = resultSet.getDouble("salary");

                            System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Salary: " + salary);
                        }
                    } catch (SQLException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    } finally {
                        try {
                            if (resultSet != null) resultSet.close();
                            if (statement != null) statement.close();
                            if (connection != null) connection.close();
                        } catch (SQLException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    
    ```

4. **Pluggable Annotations**: Java 1.6 introduced pluggable annotations, which allowed developers to define their own annotations and write annotation processors to process them.This feature facilitated the development of tools that could analyze and generate code based on custom annotations.
   ```java 
            import java.lang.annotation.*;
        import java.lang.reflect.*;

        // Define a custom annotation
        @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
        @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
        @interface MyAnnotation {
            String value();
        }

        // Use the custom annotation on a method
        class MyClass {
            @MyAnnotation("Hello, Pluggable Annotations!")
            public void myMethod() {
                // Method implementation
            }
        }

        public class AnnotationProcessor {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Get the class and method
                Class<MyClass> clazz = MyClass.class;
                Method method = null;
                try {
                    method = clazz.getMethod("myMethod");
                } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

                // Process the custom annotation
                if (method != null && method.isAnnotationPresent(MyAnnotation.class)) {
                    MyAnnotation annotation = method.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
                    System.out.println(annotation.value());
                }
            }
        }
   
   ```

5. **Integrated Web Services**: Java 1.6 included the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) 2.0, which provided a standardized and simplified approach for developing and consuming web services. It offered improved support for SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and XML-based web services.
   ```java 
            import javax.jws.*;

            @WebService
            public interface HelloWorldService {
                @WebMethod
                String sayHello(String name);
            }

            @WebService(endpointInterface = "HelloWorldService")
            public class HelloWorldServiceImpl implements HelloWorldService {
                public String sayHello(String name) {
                    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
                }
            }

            import javax.xml.ws.*;

            public class HelloWorldServicePublisher {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    HelloWorldService service = new HelloWorldServiceImpl();
                    String address = "http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldService";
                    Endpoint.publish(address, service);
                    System.out.println("Service published at: " + address);
                }
            }
   ```

6. **Java Compiler API**: Java 1.6 introduced the Java Compiler API (javax.tools), which allowed developers to programmatically invoke the Java compiler from within their applications.This feature enabled dynamic code generation and compilation at runtime.
   ```java 
            import javax.tools.*;

        public class CompilerExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String sourceCode = "public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\"); } }";

                JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
                StandardJavaFileManager fileManager = compiler.getStandardFileManager(null, null, null);

                StringSourceJavaFileObject javaFile = new StringSourceJavaFileObject("HelloWorld", sourceCode);
                Iterable<? extends JavaFileObject> compilationUnits = Arrays.asList(javaFile);

                DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject> diagnostics = new DiagnosticCollector<>();
                CompilationTask task = compiler.getTask(null, fileManager, diagnostics, null, null, compilationUnits);

                boolean success = task.call();

                if (success) {
                    System.out.println("Compilation successful!");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Compilation failed!");
                    for (Diagnostic<? extends JavaFileObject> diagnostic : diagnostics.getDiagnostics()) {
                        System.out.println(diagnostic.getMessage(null));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        class StringSourceJavaFileObject extends SimpleJavaFileObject {
            private String sourceCode;

            protected StringSourceJavaFileObject(String name, String sourceCode) {
                super(URI.create("string:///" + name.replace('.', '/') + Kind.SOURCE.extension), Kind.SOURCE);
                this.sourceCode = sourceCode;
            }

            @Override
            public CharSequence getCharContent(boolean ignoreEncodingErrors) {
                return sourceCode;
            }
        }
   ```

7. **Desktop Enhancements**: Java 1.6 included several improvements to the desktop-related APIs, such as the Java Sound API, the Java 2D API, and the Java Accessibility API. These enhancements aimed to provide better multimedia support, improved graphics rendering, and enhanced accessibility features for desktop applications.
   ```java 
            import javax.sound.sampled.*;

            public class SoundExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Define the audio format
                        AudioFormat audioFormat = new AudioFormat(44100, 16, 2, true, false);

                        // Get the default audio output line
                        DataLine.Info dataLineInfo = new DataLine.Info(SourceDataLine.class, audioFormat);
                        SourceDataLine sourceDataLine = (SourceDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(dataLineInfo);

                        // Open the audio line and start playing
                        sourceDataLine.open(audioFormat);
                        sourceDataLine.start();

                        // Create a simple sound (a beep)
                        byte[] soundData = new byte[44100];
                        for (int i = 0; i < soundData.length; i++) {
                            soundData[i] = (byte) (Math.sin(2.0 * Math.PI * 440.0 * i / 44100.0) * 127.0);
                        }

                        // Play the sound
                        sourceDataLine.write(soundData, 0, soundData.length);

                        // Wait for the sound to finish playing
                        sourceDataLine.drain();
                        sourceDataLine.close();
                    } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```

8. **Security Enhancements**: Java 1.6 introduced various security enhancements, including improvements to the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), and the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS). These enhancements focused on strengthening the security of Java applications and protecting against potential vulnerabilities.
   ```java 
            import java.io.*;
            import java.net.*;
            import javax.net.ssl.*;

            public class SSLClientExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try {
                        // Create an SSL socket factory with default settings
                        SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();

                        // Connect to the server with SSL/TLS
                        String serverHost = "your_server_host";
                        int serverPort = 443; // Default SSL/TLS port
                        SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(serverHost, serverPort);

                        // Perform SSL/TLS handshake
                        sslSocket.startHandshake();

                        // Send and receive data through the SSL socket (add your data handling logic here)
                        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
                        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));

                        out.println("Hello, Server!");
                        String response = in.readLine();
                        System.out.println("Server Response: " + response);

                        // Close the SSL socket
                        sslSocket.close();
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```

9.  **Other Improvements**: Java 1.6 also included various other improvements, such as the addition of the Java Compiler API (javax.tools) for dynamic code compilation, enhancements tothe Java Management Extensions (JMX) API, improved monitoring and diagnostic tools, and updated XML processing libraries (JAXP 1.4). It's important to note that Java 1.6 is quite old and has reached its end of life. It is recommended to use a newer version of Java, such as Java 8 or higher, to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates provided by the Java platform.
    ```java 
            import java.lang.management.*;
            import javax.management.*;

            public class JMXExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                    MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
                    
                    // Create a simple MBean for monitoring a counter
                    ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.example:type=Counter");
                    Counter mbean = new Counter();
                    mbs.registerMBean(mbean, name);

                    System.out.println("JMX MBean registered. You can now use JConsole to monitor the counter.");

                    // Keep the program running to allow JConsole to connect and monitor the MBean
                    Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);
                }
            }

            // A simple MBean implementation representing a counter
            class Counter implements CounterMBean {
                private int count;

                public void increment() {
                    count++;
                }

                public int getCount() {
                    return count;
                }
            }

            // CounterMBean interface defining the MBean operations and attributes
            interface CounterMBean {
                void increment();
                int getCount();
            }
    ```


Java 1.7

Java 1.7, also known as Java 7, was a significant release of the Java programming language and platform. It introduced several new features and enhancements to improve developer productivity and code readability. Some of the key features introduced in Java 1.7 include:

1) **Strings in switch**: Prior to Java 1.7, switch statements only supported integral types and enums. With Java 7, you can use strings in switch statements, making the code more expressive and readable.
   ```java 
            public class StringSwitchExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String fruit = "apple";

                switch (fruit) {
                    case "apple":
                        System.out.println("Selected fruit: Apple");
                        break;
                    case "orange":
                        System.out.println("Selected fruit: Orange");
                        break;
                    case "banana":
                        System.out.println("Selected fruit: Banana");
                        break;
                    default:
                        System.out.println("Unknown fruit");
                        break;
                }
            }
        }
   ```

2) **Type Inference for Generic Instance Creation (Diamond Operator)**: The diamond operator (<>) allows you to instantiate a generic class without repeating its type parameters. It improves code readability and reduces verbosity. For example:
   ```java

        // Before Java 1.7

        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

        // Java 1.7 and later

        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   ```

1) **Automatic Resource Management (try-with-resources)**: Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which simplifies the management of resources that need to be closed after being used (e.g., file streams, database connections). With try-with-resources, you can declare resources within the try block, and the Java runtime automatically closes them when the block exits, even in the event of an exception.
    ```java
            // Before Java 1.7

            InputStream inputStream = null;

            try {

            inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt"); // Code to work with the input stream

            } catch (IOException e) {

            // Exception handling

            } finally {

            if (inputStream != null) {

            inputStream.close();

            }

            }

            // Java 1.7 and later

            try (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {

            // Code to work with the input stream

            } catch (IOException e) {

            // Exception handling

            }
    ```
4) **Improved Exception Handling:** Java 7 introduced multi-catch and final rethrow, allowing you to catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block and rethrow an exception while maintaining the original exception's stack trace.

    ```java
            **// Multi-catch**

            try {

            // Some code that may throw different types of exceptions

            } catch (IOException | SQLException e) {

            // Handle both IOException and SQLException in the same block

            }

            **// Final rethrow**

            try {

            // Some code that may throw an exception

            } catch (Exception e) {

            // Handle the exception

            throw e; // Rethrow the exception while maintaining the original stack trace }
    ```
5) **Fork/Join Framework**: The fork/join framework is a powerful addition to the Java concurrency utilities, allowing developers to write efficient parallel code to take advantage of multi-core processors. It provides the ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinTask, and RecursiveTask classes to implement parallel algorithms easily.
   

6) **Numeric Literals with Underscores:** Java 7 introduced a feature that allows underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. This is particularly useful for large numbers.
    ```java

            int million = 1_000_000;

            long creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L;
    ```

7) **NIO\.2 (New I/O) enhancements**: The NIO\.2 package was introduced with Java 7, providing various enhancements to the file I/O operations, including support for symbolic links, file attributes, file system walking, and asynchronous I/O operations\.
   ```java
            import java.io.IOException;
            import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
            import java.nio.file.*;
            import java.util.List;

            public class FileReadExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Path filePath = Paths.get("path/to/your/file.txt");

                    try {
                        List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(filePath, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
                        for (String line : lines) {
                            System.out.println(line);
                        }
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
   ```
**Java 1.8 :**

Java 1.8, released in March 2014, was a significant update to the Java programming language and platform. It introduced several new features and concepts that aimed to improve code readability, conciseness, and performance. Some of the key features and concepts introduced in Java 1.8 include:

1. **Lambda Expressions:** Lambda expressions brought functional programming constructs to Java, allowing developers to write more concise and expressive code. Lambdas are anonymous functions that can be treated as data and passed around, enabling more flexible and functional-style programming.
**Example of using lambda expressions:** 
    ```java

        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); numbers.forEach((n) -> System.out.println(n));

    ```

2. **Stream API:** The Stream API complements the introduction of lambda expressions and provides a set of powerful and declarative methods for processing collections of data. Streams allow for concise and efficient operations such as map, filter, reduce, and more.
**Example of using the Stream API:**

    ```java

        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"); long count = names.stream()

        .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")) .count();

    ```

3. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:** Java 1.8 introduced the ability to define default and static methods in interfaces. Default methods provide a way to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Static methods allow interfaces to include utility methods that don't require an instance of the implementing class.
**Example of a default method in an interface:** 
    ```java

            interface MyInterface {

            default void sayHello() {

            System.out.println("Hello from MyInterface!"); }

            }

    ```

4. **Functional Interfaces:** Functional interfaces are interfaces with exactly one abstract method, and they are crucial for working with lambda expressions. Java 1.8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to indicate that an interface is intended to be used as a functional interface.
**Example of a functional interface:** 
    ```java

            @FunctionalInterface

            interface MyFunctionalInterface {

            void doSomething();

            }

    ```

5. **Date and Time API (java.time):** Java 1.8 introduced a new Date and Time API, located in the `java.time` package, to overcome the limitations of the older `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes. The new API provides better immutability, thread-safety, and a more intuitive way to work with dates and times.
**Example of using the Date and Time API:** 
    ```java

        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();

    ```

6. **Method References:** Method references allow developers to refer to methods without invoking them explicitly. They are a shorthand syntax for using lambdas when the lambda body just calls a single method.
**Example of using method references:**

    ```java

        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"); names.forEach(System.out::println);

    ```

7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine:** Java 1.8 included the Nashorn JavaScript engine, which provides better performance and compatibility with modern JavaScript features. It allows Java developers to execute JavaScript code within their applications.
These features introduced in Java 1.8 significantly improved the language's capabilities, making it more expressive, efficient, and suitable for modern development practices. It further solidified Java's position as a leading programming language in various domains.
    ```java
            mport javax.script.*;

            public class NashornExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
                    ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("nashorn");

                    try {
                        String jsCode = "var x = 10; var y = 20; var sum = x + y; sum;";
                        Object result = engine.eval(jsCode);
                        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
                    } catch (ScriptException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
    ```

**Java 9 :**

Java 9, also known as Java SE 9 (Standard Edition 9), was released on September 21, 2017. It introduced several significant features and enhancements compared to its predecessor, Java 8. Here are some of the key features of Java 9:

1. **Modular System (Project Jigsaw):** Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), also known as Project Jigsaw. This feature aimed to improve scalability,security, and maintainability of Java applications by introducing a modular system at the platform level. It allowed developers to define modules, which encapsulated code and resources, and provided explicit dependencies between modules.
   ```java
        module com.example.mymodule {
        requires java.base; // Requires dependency on the core Java module (java.base)
        requires transitive com.example.anothermodule; // Requires transitive dependency on another module
        exports com.example.mypackage; // Exports the specified package to other modules
   ```

2. **REPL (JShell):** Java 9 introduced a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool called JShell. It provided an interactive command-line interface for writing and evaluating Java code snippets without the need for compiling and running a complete Java program. JShell facilitated quick experimentation, prototyping, and learning of the Java language.
   ```java

3. **Improved Process API:** Java 9 introduced enhancements to the Process API by introducing a new set of interfaces and classes in the java.lang.ProcessHandle package. This API provided more control and information about native processes, allowing developers to manage and monitor processes more effectively.
   ```java
            import java.util.stream.Stream;

            public class ProcessHandleExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Stream<ProcessHandle> processes = ProcessHandle.allProcesses();

                    processes.forEach(process -> {
                        ProcessHandle.Info info = process.info();
                        System.out.println("Process ID: " + process.pid());
                        System.out.println("Command: " + info.command().orElse("N/A"));
                        System.out.println("Arguments: " + String.join(" ", info.arguments().orElse(new String[] {})));
                        System.out.println("User: " + info.user().orElse("N/A"));
                        System.out.println("CPU Duration: " + info.totalCpuDuration().orElse(0L));
                        System.out.println("Start Time: " + info.startInstant().orElse(null));
                        System.out.println("-----------------------------------");
                    });
                }
            }

   ```

4. **Collection Factory Methods:** Java 9 added a set of static factory methods to the List, Set, and Map interfaces, making it easier to create immutable instances of these collections.These factory methods provided a concise and readable way to initialize collection instances.
   ```java
            import java.util.*;

            public class CollectionFactoryMethodsExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // List.of() - Create an immutable list
                    List<String> fruits = List.of("Apple", "Orange", "Banana");
                    System.out.println("Fruits: " + fruits);

                    // Set.of() - Create an immutable set
                    Set<Integer> numbers = Set.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
                    System.out.println("Numbers: " + numbers);

                    // Map.of() - Create an immutable map
                    Map<String, Integer> scores = Map.of("John", 90, "Alice", 95, "Bob", 80);
                    System.out.println("Scores: " + scores);

                    // Map.ofEntries() - Create an immutable map with more than 10 key-value pairs
                    Map<String, Integer> scoresMap = Map.ofEntries(
                        Map.entry("John", 90),
                        Map.entry("Alice", 95),
                        Map.entry("Bob", 80)
                    );
                    System.out.println("Scores Map: " + scoresMap);
                }
            }
   ```

5. **Reactive Streams API:** Java 9 included the Reactive Streams API as a standardized approach for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. This API provided a common set of interfaces, classes, and protocols for building reactive and scalable systems that could handle large amounts of data streams.
   ```java
            import java.util.concurrent.Flow.*;

            public class ReactiveStreamsExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Create a simple publisher
                    Publisher<Integer> publisher = new Publisher<Integer>() {
                        @Override
                        public void subscribe(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
                            subscriber.onSubscribe(new Subscription() {
                                private int count = 1;
                                private boolean canceled = false;

                                @Override
                                public void request(long n) {
                                    if (!canceled) {
                                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                                            subscriber.onNext(count++);
                                        }
                                    } else {
                                        subscriber.onComplete();
                                    }
                                }

                                @Override
                                public void cancel() {
                                    canceled = true;
                                    subscriber.onComplete();
                                }
                            });
                        }
                    };

                    // Create a simple subscriber
                    Subscriber<Integer> subscriber = new Subscriber<Integer>() {
                        private Subscription subscription;
                        private int remaining = 5;

                        @Override
                        public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
                            this.subscription = subscription;
                            subscription.request(5); // Request initial 5 items
                        }

                        @Override
                        public void onNext(Integer item) {
                            System.out.println("Received: " + item);
                            remaining--;
                            if (remaining == 0) {
                                subscription.cancel(); // Cancel the subscription after receiving 5 items
                            } else {
                                subscription.request(1); // Request the next item
                            }
                        }

                        @Override
                        public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
                            System.err.println("Error: " + throwable.getMessage());
                        }

                        @Override
                        public void onComplete() {
                            System.out.println("Completed.");
                        }
                    };

                    // Subscribe the subscriber to the publisher
                    publisher.subscribe(subscriber);
                }
            }
   ```

6. **HTTP/2 Support:** Java 9 added support for the HTTP/2 protocol in the java.net.http package. This feature allowed developers to build HTTP/2 clients and servers natively within the Java platform, providing improved performance, multiplexing, and other features offered by the HTTP/2 protocol.
   ```java
            import java.net.URI;
            import java.net.http.HttpClient;
            import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
            import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

            public class Http2ClientExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

                    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                            .uri(URI.create("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"))
                            .GET()
                            .build();

                    try {
                        HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

                        System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.statusCode());
                        System.out.println("Response Body: " + response.body());
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }

   ```

7. **Multi-Release JAR Files:** Java 9 introduced a mechanism called multi-release JAR files. It allowed developers to include different versions of class files in the same JAR file,targeting specific Java versions. This feature enabled libraries and frameworks to provide compatibility with multiple Java versions without requiring separate distribution packages.
   ```java
        my-library.jar
        |
        |-- META-INF/
            |-- versions/
                |-- 9/
                |   |-- com/
                |       |-- example/
                |           |-- MyClass.class (Java 9 specific version)
                |
                |-- 10/
                    |-- com/
                        |-- example/
                            |-- MyClass.class (Java 10 specific version) 
   ```

8. **Stream API Enhancements:** Java 9 added several enhancements to the Stream API, including new methods for taking advantage of the new Optional class features, such as stream operations that could handle nullable values more effectively.
   ```java
            import java.util.Arrays;
            import java.util.List;
            import java.util.Optional;

            public class StreamAndOptionalExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "John", "Michael", null, "Sarah");

                    // Filter out null values and find the first name starting with "J"
                    Optional<String> firstNameStartingWithJ = names.stream()
                            .filter(name -> name != null)
                            .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
                            .findFirst();

                    // Print the result
                    firstNameStartingWithJ.ifPresentOrElse(
                            name -> System.out.println("First name starting with 'J': " + name),
                            () -> System.out.println("No name starting with 'J' found.")
                    );
                }
            }
   ```

9.  **Platform Logging API and Service:** Java 9 introduced a new common logging system called the Platform Logging API and Service. It provided a standard API for logging across various Java SE Platform components and allowed developers to configure and use their preferred logging framework.These are just some of the key features introduced in Java 9. Java 9 also included other smaller enhancements, performance improvements, and bug fixes. It's important to note that with the release of Java 9, the Java platform transitioned from a traditional release cycle to a new rapid release model, with new versions being released approximately every six months, introducing smaller but more frequent updates to the Java platform.
    ```java 
            import java.util.logging.*;

            public class PlatformLoggingExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Get the system logger
                    System.Logger logger = System.getLogger("PlatformLoggingExample");

                    // Log messages at different levels
                    logger.log(System.Logger.Level.INFO, "This is an information message.");
                    logger.log(System.Logger.Level.WARNING, "This is a warning message.");
                    logger.log(System.Logger.Level.ERROR, "This is an error message.");

                    // Use the built-in logging levels directly
                    logger.info("This is another information message.");
                    logger.warning("This is another warning message.");
                    logger.error("This is another error message.");
                }
            }
    ```

**Java 10**

Java 10 was released on March 20, 2018. It introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Here are some of the key features introduced in Java 10:

1) **Local Variable Type Inference (var)**:Java 10 introduced the var keyword, which allows you to declare local variables with inferred types. The compiler automatically determines the type based on the initialization value. This feature reduces boilerplate code while maintaining strong typing.
Example:
    ```java

        var number = 42; // Compiler infers that 'number' is of type int

        var message = "Hello, Java 10!"; // Compiler infers that 'message' is of type String
    ```

2) **Garbage-Collector Interface**:Java 10 added a new clean-up API, the java.lang.ref.Cleaner class, that makes it easier to manage resources associated with objects. It enables developers to register cleanup actions to be executed when an object becomes unreachable.
   ```java
            import java.lang.ref.Cleaner;

            public class ResourceHolder implements AutoCloseable {
                private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();

                private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;

                public ResourceHolder() {
                    // Register the cleanup action when the ResourceHolder object becomes unreachable
                    this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, new ResourceCleanup());
                }

                @Override
                public void close() {
                    // Perform any necessary cleanup when explicitly closed
                    cleanable.clean();
                }

                private static class ResourceCleanup implements Runnable {
                    @Override
                    public void run() {
                        // Perform cleanup actions when the ResourceHolder object becomes unreachable
                        System.out.println("Cleaning up resources...");
                    }
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    try (ResourceHolder resource = new ResourceHolder()) {
                        // Use the resource...
                    } // The close() method will be automatically called here
                }

            }
   ```

3) **Application Class-Data Sharing:** The Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS) feature helps improve startup times by sharing common class metadata between different Java processes. It allows you to archive and share the class data in the form of a shared archive (.jsa file) that can be used by multiple Java applications.
    ```java
            To use the Application Class-Data Sharing feature, you can enable it using command-line options when running the Java application. For example:
            java -Xshare:dump -XX:SharedArchiveFile=myapp.jsa -jar myapp.jar 
    ```

4) **Experimental JIT Compiler:** Java 10 introduced an experimental Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler called Graal, which is based on the GraalVM project. Graal is designed to improve performance and enable new possibilities for Java applications, but it's not the default JIT compiler in Java 10.

5) **Time-Based Release Versioning:**

Starting from Java 10, the Java platform adopted a new time-based release versioning scheme. This means that new Java versions are released on a fixed schedule, every six months, rather than being tied to specific major feature additions.

6) **Additional Standardized APIs**:

Java 10 added several new APIs, including:

   1. **java.util.stream.Collectors::teeing:** This method allows you to perform two separate aggregations on the same data in a single pass using a Collector.
        ```java
                import java.util.List;
                import java.util.stream.Collectors;

                public class TeeingExample {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

                        // Calculate the sum and product of the numbers in a single pass
                        Pair<Integer, Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                                .collect(Collectors.teeing(
                                        Collectors.summingInt(Integer::intValue),   // First aggregation: sum
                                        Collectors.reducing(1, (a, b) -> a * b),   // Second aggregation: product
                                        Pair::new                                     // Merge the results into a Pair
                                ));

                        System.out.println("Sum: " + result.first());
                        System.out.println("Product: " + result.second());
                    }
                }
        ```
   2. **java.util.Optional::orElseThrow:** This method returns the value if present in an Optional, or throws a specified exception if the Optional is empty.
        ```java
                import java.util.Optional;

                public class OrElseThrowExample {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.of("Hello, World!");

                        // Get the value if present, otherwise throw an exception
                        String result = optionalValue.orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Value not present"));

                        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
                    }
                }
        ```
   3. **java.util.List::copyOf:** This method creates an immutable list containing the elements of the specified collection.
        ```java
                import java.util.List;

                public class CopyOfExample {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        List<String> originalList = List.of("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");

                        // Create an immutable copy of the original list
                        List<String> immutableCopy = List.copyOf(originalList);

                        // Attempt to modify the immutable copy
                        // This will throw an UnsupportedOperationException
                        try {
                            immutableCopy.add("Mango");
                        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                            System.out.println("Cannot modify the immutable list.");
                        }

                        System.out.println("Original list: " + originalList);

                    }
                }
        ```

**Java 11 :**

Java 11, released in September 2018, is a long-term support (LTS) version of Java. While it didn't introduce as many major language changes as Java 8, it brought several important features, enhancements, and concepts to the language and platform. Some of the key features and concepts introduced in Java 11 include:

1. **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:** This feature allows var to be used as the type of lambda parameters. It improves readability and conciseness when dealing with complex functional interfaces.
**Example of using local-variable syntax for lambda parameters:** 
    ```java

        BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> add = (var a, var b) -> a + b;

    ```

2. **HTTP Client (Standard):** Java 11 introduced a new HTTP client API as a replacement for the older `HttpURLConnection`. The new `HttpClient` is more modern, flexible, and supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols.
**Example of using the new HTTP client:**

    ```java

            HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

            HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()

            .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))

            .GET()

            .build();

            HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()); 
    ```

3. **Epsilon:** The Epsilon garbage collector was introduced as an experimental feature in Java It is a no-op garbage collector that is useful for performance testing, short-lived applications, and scenarios where memory management is handled externally.
4. **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) (Experimental):** Java 11 included ZGC as an experimental garbage collector. ZGC is designed to offer low-latency performance by limiting the pause times during garbage collection.
5. **Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs:** Java 11 allows you to run a Java source file directly, without the need for explicit compilation. This feature is useful for running simple single-file Java programs quickly.
**Example of launching a single-file source-code program:**

                String plaintext = "Hello, world!";
                byte[] ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext.getBytes(), secretKey);
                byte[] decrypted = decrypt(ciphertext, secretKey);
                System.out.println("Decrypted: " + new String(decrypted));
            }

            private static byte[] encrypt(byte[] plaintext, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception {
                Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("ChaCha20-Poly1305");
                byte[] iv = new byte[cipher.getBlockSize()];
                new SecureRandom().nextBytes(iv);
                cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new GCMParameterSpec(128, iv));
                return cipher.doFinal(plaintext);
            }

            private static byte[] decrypt(byte[] ciphertext, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception {
                Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("ChaCha20-Poly1305");
                cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new GCMParameterSpec(128, ciphertext, 0, 12));
                return cipher.doFinal(ciphertext, 12, ciphertext.length - 12);
            }
        }
   ```

                String unicornEmoji = "\uD83E\uDD84";

                // Unicode 10.0 character: "ℇ"
                char eulerCharacter = '\u2107';

                // Unicode 10.0 character: "🧁"
                char cupcakeEmoji = '\uD83E\uDDC1';

                // Unicode 10.0 character: "㊙"
                char secretCharacter = '\u3299';

                // Unicode 10.0 character: "π"
                char piCharacter = '\u03C0';

                System.out.println("Unicode 10.0 Emoji: " + unicornEmoji);
                System.out.println("Unicode 10.0 Character: " + eulerCharacter);
                System.out.println("Unicode 10.0 Emoji: " + cupcakeEmoji);
                System.out.println("Unicode 10.0 Character: " + secretCharacter);
                System.out.println("Unicode 10.0 Character: " + piCharacter);
            }
        }
   ```

9.  **Other Minor Enhancements:** Java 11 also included several minor enhancements and optimizations to the language and platform, improving the overall performance and developer experience.It's important to note that Java 11 is an LTS version, which means it will receive long-term support and updates for an extended period. Developers and organizations looking for stability and support may consider using Java 11 for their projects. Subsequent versions of Java (such as Java 15, Java 16, etc.) have continued to introduce new features and improvements beyond Java 11.

**Java 12 :**

Java 12, also known as Java SE 12 (Standard Edition 12), was released on March 19, 2019. It introduced several new features and improvements compared to its predecessor, Java 11. Here are some of the key features of Java 12:

1. **Switch Expressions (Preview):** Java 12 introduced preview support for a new switch expression syntax, which allowed the switch statement to be used as an expression. This syntax provided a more concise and readable way to write code that had multiple possible execution paths.
   ```java 
            public class SwitchExpressionExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.TUESDAY;
                int dayValue = switch (dayOfWeek) {
                    case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 1;
                    case TUESDAY -> 2;
                    case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> 4;
                    case WEDNESDAY -> 3;
                    default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day of week: " + dayOfWeek);
                };

                System.out.println("Value of " + dayOfWeek + ": " + dayValue);
            }
        }

        enum DayOfWeek {
            MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
        }
   ```

2. **Compact Number Formatting:** Java 12 introduced a new set of APIs in the java.text package for formatting and parsing numbers in a compact format. This feature allowed developers to format numbers with symbols such as "K" for thousands and "M" for millions, making the output more readable and localized.

                char musicNoteGclef = '\uD834\uDD1E';

                // Unicode 11.0 character: "🥑" (Avocado)
                char avocadoEmoji = '\uD83E\uDD51';

                // Unicode 11.0 character: "🦑" (Squid)
                char squidEmoji = '\uD83E\uDD91';

                System.out.println("Unicode 11.0 Emoji: " + hedgehogEmoji);
                System.out.println("Unicode 11.0 Character: " + musicNoteGclef);
                System.out.println("Unicode 11.0 Emoji: " + avocadoEmoji);
                System.out.println("Unicode 11.0 Emoji: " + squidEmoji);
            }
        }
    ```

7. **Default CDS Archives:** Java 12 introduced a feature called Default Class-Data Sharing (CDS) Archives. This feature allowed the creation of shared class archives by default, making it easier to improve startup time and reduce memory footprint for Java applications.

8. **Abortable Mixed Collections for G1:** Java 12 introduced a performance improvement to the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector. It allowed G1 to abort concurrent mixed garbage collections when they exceeded a specified time threshold, preventing prolonged pauses and improving overall application responsiveness.

9. **CompletableFuture Enhancements:** Java 12 included enhancements to the CompletableFuture class in the java.util.concurrent package. It introduced new methods, such as newTimeout(), orTimeout(), and completeOnTimeout(), which provided more flexibility and control when dealing with asynchronous computations and timeouts.These are some of the key features introduced in Java 12. It's important to note that Java 12 is no longer a long-term support (LTS) release. It is recommended to use a newer LTS version, such as Java 11 or Java 17, to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates provided by the Java platform.

**Java 13** :

Java 13 was released on September 17, 2019. Here are some of the features introduced in Java 13:

1) **Text Blocks (Preview Feature)**: Text Blocks, also known as multi-line strings, were introduced as a preview feature. They aimed to simplify the representation of strings that span several lines of source code, improving the readability of code that involves multiline strings.

2) **Switch Expressions (Standard Feature)**: Java 13 enhanced the switch statement by allowing it to be used as an expression, which returns a value. This made code using switch statements more concise and less error-prone.
   ```java 
            public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int dayOfWeek = 3;

                String dayType = switch (dayOfWeek) {
                    case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday";
                    case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
                    default -> "Invalid day";
                };

                System.out.println("The day type is: " + dayType);
            }
        }
   ```

3) **Dynamic CDS Archives (Standard Feature):** Class Data Sharing (CDS) was extended to allow dynamic archiving, which improved the startup time of Java applications by sharing common class metadata across multiple processes.

**Java 14 :**

Java 14, released in March 2020, brought several new features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Some of the key features and concepts introduced in Java 14 include:

1. **Switch Expressions (Standard):** Java 14 extended switch statements to support switch expressions, which allow a switch to be used as an expression rather than just a

statement. This feature simplifies code and makes it more concise, especially when dealing with multiple cases.

**Example of using switch expressions:** ```java

String day = "Monday";

int dayNumber = switch (day) {

case "Monday" -> 1;

case "Tuesday" -> 2;

// ...

default -> 0;

};

\```

2. **Pattern Matching (Preview):** The pattern matching feature was introduced as a preview in Java 14. It simplifies code that involves conditional instance-of checks and type casting by combining them into a single construct.
**Example of using pattern matching:** 
    ```java

            if (obj instanceof String s) {

            // Use 's' as a String in this block

            }

    ```

3. **Records (Preview):** Records are a new kind of class introduced in Java 14 that provide a concise syntax for declaring simple classes that primarily act as data carriers. They automatically generate constructors, accessor methods, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods based on the class fields.
**Example of using records:**

    ```java

        record Person(String name, int age) {

        // Automatically generated constructor, accessors, equals, hashCode, and toString }

        Person person = new Person("Alice", 30); System.out.println(person.name()); // Output: Alice 
    ```

4. **Helpful NullPointerExceptions (Improvement):** In Java 14, NullPointerException messages were improved to provide more helpful information about the cause of the exception.They include details such as the variable name that caused the exception.

5. **Packaging Tool (JEP 343):** Java 14 introduced a new tool called `jpackage`, which allows developers to package Java applications as platform-specific native packages. These packages can be easily installed and run on various platforms.

6. **NUMA-Aware Memory Allocation for G1:** Java 14 improved the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector to be NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) aware, which can lead to better performance on NUMA systems.

7. **Unix-Domain Socket Channels:** Java 14 introduced support for Unix-domain socket channels, allowing Java applications to communicate using Unix domain sockets on supported platforms.

8. **JFR Event Streaming:** Java 14 enhanced Java Flight Recorder (JFR) with event streaming capabilities, making it easier to access and process JFR data programmatically.
9. **Other Performance and Security Enhancements:** Java 14 included various performance optimizations and security enhancements to improve the overall performance and robustness of the platform. As with all preview features, some of the features introduced in Java 14 might have undergone further refinements in subsequent releases based on community feedback and experience. Developers are encouraged to use the latest stable version of Java to access the most up-to-date features and improvements.

**Java 15:**

Java 15, also known as Java SE 15 (Standard Edition 15), was released on September 15, 2020. It introduced several new features and enhancements compared to its predecessor, Java 14. Here are some of the key features of Java 15:

1. **Sealed Classes (Preview):** Java 15 introduced preview support for sealed classes and interfaces. Sealed classes provided a more restricted class hierarchy, allowing developers to control which classes could extend or implement them. This feature aimed to improve encapsulation and maintainability of class hierarchies.
1. **Hidden Classes (Preview):** Java 15 introduced preview support for hidden classes. Hidden classes were classes that were not discoverable by normal class loading mechanisms, providing additional security and encapsulation for certain use cases, such as dynamic code generation.
1. **Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview):** Java 15 introduced preview support for pattern matching for the instanceof operator. This feature allowed developers to perform a type check and cast in a single operation, simplifying code and improving readability.
1. **Text Blocks (Standard):** Java 15 standardized the text blocks feature that was previewed in Java 13 and Java 14. Text blocks provided a more convenient way to write multiline string literals, allowing for better readability and reduced escape characters.
1. **ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing:** Java 15 introduced enhancements to the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) by moving thread-stack processing out of safepoints. This improvement reduced the pause time of garbage collection and improved overall application responsiveness.
1. **Unix-Domain Socket Channels:** Java 15 added support for Unix-Domain Socket Channels in the java.nio.channels package. This feature allowed Java applications to

communicate with processes running on the same machine using Unix domain sockets, providing high-performance inter-process communication.

7. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator):** Java 15 introduced the Foreign Function & Memory API as an incubator feature. This API provided a way to interoperate with native code and memory in a safer and more efficient manner, without relying on the Java Native Interface (JNI).
7. **Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA):** Java 15 added support for the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) as part of the standard cryptographic algorithms. EdDSA provided efficient and secure digital signatures based on elliptic curve cryptography.
7. **Deprecation of RMI Activation:** Java 15 deprecated the RMI Activation feature, which provided a mechanism for starting and stopping remote objects dynamically. This feature was

considered complex and underused, and its deprecation aimed to simplify the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) API.

These are some of the key features introduced in Java 15. It's important to note that Java 15 is not a long-term support (LTS) release. It is recommended to use a newer LTS version, such as Java 11 or Java 17, to take advantage of the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates provided by the Java platform.

Java 16 :

Java 16 had been released in March 2021. Some of the new features introduced in Java 16:

1) **JEP 338: Unix-Domain Socket Channels** - This feature added support for Unix-domain socket channels, which allows communication between processes on the same operating system. It provides a more efficient way of inter-process communication compared to traditional TCP/IP sockets.
1) **JEP 376: ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing** - This enhancement improves the performance of Z Garbage Collector by offloading some of the work from safepoints to concurrent phases, leading to reduced pause times.
1) **JEP 387: Elastic Metaspace** - This feature allows the Metaspace to dynamically resize itself based on application demand, reducing the risk of running out of native memory.
1) **JEP 395: Records (Standard Feature)** - Records were introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and were made a standard feature in Java 16. Records provide a compact syntax for defining classes that mainly act as immutable data carriers. They are concise and automatically generate useful methods like equals(), hashCode(), and toString().
1) **JEP 394: Pattern Matching for instanceof** - Building on the pattern matching feature introduced in Java 14, this enhancement allows the use of pattern matching in

combination with the instanceof operator, making it more convenient to extract components of an object that match specific patterns.

6) **JEP 397: Sealed Classes (Second Preview)** - Sealed classes, which were first previewed in Java 15, continued to be enhanced in Java 16. They allow you to define a limited set of subclasses that can extend a particular class, enhancing encapsulation and control over class hierarchies.
6) **JEP 338: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default** - In this JDK Enhancement Proposal, the internal APIs of the JDK were further encapsulated by default to

discourage their use by external applications. This helps to enforce better modularity and maintainability.

**Java 17 :**

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Java 17 had not been released yet. Therefore, I don't have specific information about the features and concepts introduced in Java 17. However, I can provide you with general expectations based on the usual development cycle of Java releases.

Java follows a predictable release schedule, with new versions coming out approximately every six months. Each new version typically introduces new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Some expected features and concepts that could be part of Java 17 or a later version might include:

1. **Project Loom:** Project Loom aims to bring lightweight, user-mode threads (also known as fibers) to the Java platform. This would provide a more efficient and scalable way to handle concurrency and improve the performance of multi-threaded applications.
1. **Project Panama:** Project Panama is focused on improving the connection between Java and native code. It aims to make it easier to interoperate with native libraries, especially in cases where high-performance access to native code is required.

1. **Foreign Function & Memory API:** This feature could simplify the process of working with native memory in Java and improve interoperability with native code.
1. **Enhanced Packed Objects:** This feature could optimize memory layout for packed objects, improving performance and reducing memory usage for certain data structures.
6. **Deprecation of Older Features:** Java 17 might deprecate or remove certain outdated

features and APIs that are no longer recommended for use.

7. **Improvements in Garbage Collection:** Java 17 could bring further enhancements to garbage collection algorithms to optimize memory management and application performance.
7. **New APIs and Utility Classes:** Java updates often include additions to the standard library, providing new APIs and utility classes to make common tasks easier for developers.

Please note that the actual features and enhancements in Java 17 may vary, and the information provided here is based on general expectations and the trends observed in previous Java releases. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about Java 17 features and concepts, I recommend referring to the official release notes and documentation once Java 17 is officially released.

**Java 18 :**

Java 18 builds a stronger community daily with new updates and releases. Here is a list of all the features of the new Java 18.

**Pattern Matching for Switch**

The pattern matching for the switch feature of Java 18 has been again released for its second preview. There are not any major changes from the first preview. It is all set to become a standard feature in Java 19. The changes from the first preview are only regarding improved exhaustiveness check and other clarification & checks concerning dominance checks.

**Improvements to Javac Compiler**

Javac Compiler has also observed several improvements in Java 18. It aims to minimize unintentional memory leaks, usually due to inner classes. Developers are not always aware that the instances of an internal class have an implicit reference to the example of the enclosing class. This access is not always used and leads to memory leaks.

**Expand Checks of Javac’s Serial Lint Warning in the newest version of Java**

The checking mechanism in Java 18 has improved significantly. Now, Javac’s lint warnings have been expanded with serialization warnings. Along with checking for the existence of the serialVersionUID field, it also performs checks. Like other warning suppressors, the serial lint warnings can also be suppressed with @SuppressWarnings(“serial”).

**Code Snippets in Java API Documentation**

The java compiler has also seen significant improvements. In the Java 18 update, better support has been provided for code snippets as part of the documentation. This is part of the JEP 413 that includes support for syntax highlights. The new feature also allows IDEs and other tools to efficiently differentiate code snippets while documenting. This helps in providing linting while editing, code insights, and highlights.

**String Deduplication**

Java 8 was the first update that included String deduplication as a G1 garbage collector feature. The feature automatically identifies identical strings and deduplicates them. This ensures a better memory footprint. However, in Java 8, this feature was only extended to OpenJDK. With the new Java 18, this feature will also extend to ParallelGC, ZGC, and SerialGC.

**Finalization Deprecated for Removal**

The latest Java 18 promoted the removal of finalization (JEP421). Finalization enables a callback invoked when any object is being treated and collected as garbage and has many issues. Removal of finalization will minimize garbage collection impact and will have a positive impact on potential performance.

**Internet-Address Resolution SPI**

Controlling the internet address resolution is an exciting and much-needed feature of Java 18. This feature would allow the developer to register a ServiceProvider that will be responsible for handling hostname to IP resolutions. A perfect use case for this feature is unit testing. The improved control on caching would ensure that a hostname within a JVM instance’s lifetime is resolved to different IPs.

**Simple Web Server**

The use of HTTP servers in Java has continued for a very long time. But, this tends to be complicated and provides dynamic resolution. Now, in the latest version of Java - Java 18 as part of JEP 408, a new, much simpler version of the web server has been introduced. The new version will facilitate testing, ad-hoc development, etc.

**Java 19:**

Java 19 features structured concurrency, virtual threads, pattern matching for switch expressions, a vector API, and a Linux/RISC-V port.

The JDK 19 features include:

1) **Structured concurrency**, in an incubator phase, is intended to simplify multithreaded programming through a structured concurrency API. This concurrency treats multiple tasks

running in different threads as a single unit of work, to streamline error handling and cancellation. Reliability and observability are improved. This feature is from Project Loom, which introduced a new lightweight concurrency model.

2) A **preview of record patterns**, to deconstruct record values. Record patterns and type patterns can be nested to enable a declarative, powerful, and composable form of data

navigation and processing. Goals of the proposal include extending pattern matching to express more sophisticated, composable data queries while not changing the syntax or semantics of type patterns. This proposal builds on pattern matching for instanceof, delivered in JDK 16 in March 2021. Future plans may call for record patterns to be extended with capabilities such as array patterns and vararg patterns. Record patterns is part of Project Amber, an effort to explore and incubate smaller, productivity-oriented Java features.

3) A preview of a **foreign function and memory API**, which would introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. By

efficiently invoking foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM) and safely accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM) the API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process native data without the danger and brittleness of the Java Native Interface (JNI). The foreign function and memory API combines two earlier incubating APIs: the foreign memory access API and the foreign linker API. The foreign function and memory API was previously incubated in JDK 17 and reincubated in JDK 18. The proposal's goals include ease of use, performance, generality, and safety.

4) A preview of **virtual threads**, which are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput, concurrent applications. Goals

include enabling server applications written in the simple thread-per-request style to scale with near-optimal hardware utilization, enabling existing code that uses the java.lang Thread API to adopt virtual threads with minimal change, and enable troubleshooting, debugging, and profiling of virtual threads with existing JDK tools. It is not a goal of this proposal to change the basic concurrency model in Java or offer a new data parallelism construct in either the Java language or Java libraries. Nor is it a goal to remove the traditional implementation of threads or to silently migrate existing applications to use virtual threads. This feature is also part of Project Loom.

5) **A third preview of pattern matching for switch expressions and statements,** extending pattern matching to switch, to allow an expression to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so complex data-oriented queries can be

expressed concisely and safely. This capability previously was previewed in JDK 17 and JDK

18. The third preview would add refinements including the replacement of guarded patterns with when clauses in switch blocks. Also, the runtime semantics of a pattern switch when the value of the selector expression is null are more closely aligned with legacy switch semantics. The plan's goals include expanding the expressiveness and applicability of switch expressions and statements by allowing patterns to appear in case labels. Other goals include allowing developers to relax the historic null-hostility of switch when desired, increasing the safety of switch statements and ensuring that existing switch expressions and statements continue to compile with no changes and execute with identical semantics. The hope is to eventually support pattern matching throughout Java, adding it to places where expressions are used. This feature also is part of the Amber project.
6) A fourth incubation of a **vector API** that would express vector computations that reliably compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU architectures, thus achieving performance superior to equivalent scalar computations. Developers using the API gain a way to write complex vector algorithms in Java, using the HotSpot auto-vectorizer but with a user model that makes vectorizations more predictable and robust. The vector API previously was incubated into JDK 16, JDK 17, and JDK 19.

Improvements to the API proposed for JDK 19 include enhancements to load and store vectors to and from MemorySegments, as defined by the Foreign Function and Memory API preview. JDK 19 would also add two cross-lane vector operations, compress and expand, together with a complementary vector mask compress operation. The compress vector operation maps lanes of a source vector, selected by a mask, to a destination vector in lane order, while the expand operation does the inverse. The compress operation is useful in filtering query results.

In another addition to the vector API, bitwise integral lane wise operations would be expanded, including operations such counting the number of one bits, reversing the order of bits, and compressing and expanding bits. Goals of the API included being clear and concise, platform-agnostic, having reliable runtime and compilation performance on x64 and AArch64 architectures, and enabling “graceful” degradation, for situations in which a vector computation cannot be fully expressed at runtime as a sequence of vector operations. The vector API is from Project Panama, which aims to enable simpler communications between native and JVM code.

7) With the **Linux/RISC-V port,** Java would gain support for a hardware instruction set that is already supported by a wide range of language toolchains. RISC-V actually is a family of related ISAs. The Linux/RISC-V port would only support the RV64GV configuration of RISC-V, a general purpose 64-bit ISA that includes vector instructions. The developers of Java may consider other RISC-V configurations in the future.

The port would support the following HotSpot VM options: the template interpreter, C1 (client) JIT compiler, C2 (server) JIT compiler, and all current mainline garbage collectors including ZGC and Shenandoah. The actual porting is nearly complete; the focus of the JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) is integration of the port into the JDK mainline repository.

**Java 20 :**

This short-term Java release will be supported for six months following the September 20, 2022 release of [JDK 19](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-19-features). We anticipate the long-term support (LTS) release of Java 21, due in September, to provide even greater updates backed by years of support. Until then, let’s dive into what’s new in JDK 20.

Seven features have been officially marked for the Java 20 release, including: virtual threads, a vector API proposal, structured concurrency, scoped values, a foreign function and memory API, record patterns, pattern matching for switch statements and expressions, and a vector API proposal.

**Virtual Threads**

Virtual Threads are a prerequisite for structured concurrency. Since the first preview in JDK 19, minor changes have been made, including a small number of API changes, as well as degradations to ThreadGroup. Now in the second preview stage, these lightweight threads reduce the effort of writing and maintaining concurrent applications. According to Oracle, this will radically change how Java applications are scaled.

**Vector API Proposal**

Previously, the Vector API was incubated in [JDK 16](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-16-features), [JDK 17](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-17-features), [JDK 18](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-18-features), and [JDK 19](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-19-features). This new API proposal was added a few weeks before the launch of Java 20 as a re-incubation, with no changes in the API relative to JDK 19. The implementation includes a small number of bug fixes and performance enhancements, including the ability to express vector computations that reliably compile at runtime and act as optimal vector instructions on supported CPUs.

**Structured Concurrency**

Delivered in JDK 19 as an incubating API, Structured Concurrency works by treating multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work. This helps streamline error handling and cancellation, thereby improving reliability and enhancing observability. The only change with its re-incubation isStructuredTaskScope being updated to support the inheritance of scoped values by threads created in a task scope.

**Scoped Values**

Scoped Values enable immutable data to be shared across and within threads. They’re preferred to thread-local variables, especially when used with a large number of virtual threads. Goals of this incubating API include ease of use, comprehensibility, robustness, and performance.

**Foreign Function and Memory API**

The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API combines two earlier incubating APIs: the Foreign-Memory Access API and the Foreign Linker API. The FFM API was first incubated in JDK 17 before being re-incubated in JDK 18; it was then first previewed in JDK 19. Based on user feedback, JDK 20 re-previews the FFM API to include the following refinements:

- MemorySegment andMemoryAddress abstractions are unified (memory addresses are now modeled by zero-length memory segments)
- SealedMemoryLayout hierarchy is enhanced to facilitate usage with pattern matching inswitch expressions and statements
- MemorySession has been split intoArena andSegmentScope to facilitate sharing segments across maintenance boundaries

**Record Patterns**

The main goals of the second preview of Record Patterns are to extend pattern matching to express more sophisticated, composable data queries, as well as to maintain the syntax or semantics of type patterns. Since the first preview of this language feature delivered in JDK 19, expect the following changes in Java 20: added support for inference of type arguments of generic record patterns, support for record patterns to appear in the header of an enhanced for statement, and removal of support for named record patterns.

**Pattern Matching for Switch Statements and Expressions**

Pattern Matching was initially proposed as a preview and delivered in JDK 17, proposed for a second preview and delivered in JDK 18, and proposed for a third preview and delivered in JDK

19. This language feature’s fourth preview in JDK 20 enables its continued co-evolution with the Record Patterns preview feature, and includes basic updates to grammar around switch statements.

Java 21-

Java 21 is set to be released on *19-Sep-2023*, as the next long-term support (LTS) release of Oracle’s standard Java implementation. Java 21 will have the following 15 features.![](Aspose.Words.7e701ab6-f21c-43b1-87b2-db7c0845914d.004.png)
